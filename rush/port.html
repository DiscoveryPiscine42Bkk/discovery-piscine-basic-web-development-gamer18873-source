        <p> My name is [Your Name], and I am writing to express my keen interest in the Web Developer position at your company. With a strong passion for building efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites, I am eager to contribute my technical skills and creative mindset to your development team.

        Over the past few years, I have developed a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as experience working with Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I have also built several personal and academic projects that strengthened my understanding of responsive design, API integration, and clean code practices.

        What truly drives me as a developer is the ability to turn ideas into functional and meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my craft. I believe that collaboration, curiosity, and persistence are key qualities that make a great developer — and I bring all three to every project I work on.

        I am particularly interested in joining [Company Name] because I admire your commitment to innovation and quality. I am confident that my technical background, combined with my motivation to learn and grow, aligns well with your team’s goals and values.

        Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your company and contribute to building modern, impactful web solutions. </p> <!--พูดถึงเป้าหมาย-->
